# GWC Instructions

This is a starting repository for the [Westwood Girls Who Code club](http://westwoodgwc.wix.com/westwoodgirlswhocode). The instructions below will help 
you deploy your mobile application to [Cloud9](http://cloud9.io/). 

## Step 1 - set up a Cloud9 account

Cloud9 is a development environment in the cloud. With [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net) you were able to quickly code
and test your [JQuery mobile](http://jquerymobile.com/) application. However, previewing your application on a 
mobile device didn't work so well.  Moving your application to Cloud9 will let you run your application in the cloud
in a way that is very similar to how professional developers work. 

The first step is to [sign up](https://c9.io/web/sign-up/free) for a free account.

## Step 2 - Create a workspace

Once you are registered, go to your dashboard and click "Create new workspace".  Select "Clone from URL"
and use the url of this repository: https://github.com/orb/mobiledemo

## Step 3 - Copy your jsfiddle code

Enter the your project and find the `index.html` file.  The places to insert your HTML and Javascript from your 
fiddle are marked.  

## Step 3 - Run your project

Press the run button.  Cloud9 will start your application and show you the URL of your application.  You can 
access your jQuery mobile application in your web browser to test.  If your application is working, try visiting
it on a phone or tablet.

## Step 4 - Smile

Congratulations!  You've now deployed your first application.  You can send the URL to friends and family
to show them your work, but with the free cloud9 account they will only be able to access it while
you are using the Cloud9 IDE.
